Create a detailed and expansive 2000x2000 background image for the first level of a video game titled "Zombies Vs Family". The scene is set in a post-apocalyptic away from city environment at the break of dawn, where nature has started reclaiming the abandoned and dilapidated cityscape. The map should feature a mix of open plain soily area, overgrown bushes and trees here and there on the map, and a jungle on the edges of the map, now eerily silent.

Designate specific spawn points for players and zombies with subtle indicators: for players, a lit beacon or a makeshift camp with survival gear; for zombies, areas shrouded in mist or darkened alleyways. The map's edges should subtly encourage players to explore towards the center, where the main objectives and challenges lie.

The atmosphere should convey a sense of desolation but also of hope, with the first light of dawn cutting through the darkness, hinting at the survival and defense against the undead. This image will set the tone for an immersive and strategic gameplay experience, emphasizing exploration, combat, and survival.
